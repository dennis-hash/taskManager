***INTRODUCTION***

In today's fast-paced corporate environment, efficient task management is crucial for the success of any organisation. Company ABC recognizes the need for a robust system to manage tasks and provide visibility into the progress of various activities. TaskPro emerges as the solution to this challenge, offering a comprehensive platform for task management and reporting. By streamlining the process of task allocation, monitoring, and reporting, TaskPro aims to enhance productivity and accountability across all levels of the organisation.

**1.1 Problem Statement**

Company ABC currently lacks a centralised system for task management, leading to inefficiencies and lack of visibility into ongoing activities. Tasks are often managed through different methods, making it challenging to track their progress and allocate resources effectively. This fragmented approach results in delays, miscommunication, and missed deadlines, ultimately impacting the organisation's overall performance. TaskPro seeks to address these challenges by providing a unified platform for managing tasks and facilitating transparent communication between employees and management. 
The software aims to streamline task management processes by providing an easy-to-use interface for employees to manage tasks through various stages. Additionally, the software should automate the generation of weekly reports showcasing tasks in each stage, facilitating efficient communication between employees and management.

**1.2 Objectives**

Develop an intuitive user interface that simplifies task management and encourages user adoption.
Implement dynamic task stages to accommodate the evolving nature of projects and tasks within the organisation.
Generate automated weekly reports showcasing the status of tasks in each stage and distribute them to relevant stakeholders within the organisation.
Ensure the completeness and accuracy of the solution, delivering a fully functional software that meets the specified requirements.
Uphold high standards of solution quality, including code coverage, accuracy, report quality, and stress testing metrics.
Collaborate effectively within the team, utilising tools like GitHub for code management and task coordination.

**LITERATURE REVIEW**

2.1 Overview

Effective task management is essential for the smooth operation of any organisation. However, many companies face various challenges in managing tasks efficiently. Some of the current task management challenges include:
2.1.1 Complexity of Tasks

Tasks in modern workplaces often involve multiple steps and dependencies, making them complex to manage. It becomes challenging to track progress and ensure timely completion, especially when tasks are interconnected.
2.1.2 Dynamic Task Prioritization

Prioritising tasks based on changing business requirements and deadlines is a constant challenge. Without a flexible system in place, teams may struggle to adjust priorities effectively, leading to missed deadlines and unmet goals.
2.1.3 Resource Allocation

Allocating resources such as manpower, time, and budget to tasks requires careful planning. Limited resources and competing priorities often result in resource conflicts, affecting task execution and overall project success.

2.1.4 Tracking Progress

 Monitoring the progress of tasks across different stages is challenging, especially in larger projects with numerous tasks and team members. Without real-time visibility into task status and bottlenecks, managers may struggle to identify and address issues promptly.
 
2.1.6 Remote Work Challenges

With the rise of remote work, managing tasks across distributed teams presents additional challenges. Ensuring effective communication, collaboration, and accountability in a remote work environment requires suitable tools and strategies.

2.2 Existing systems

2.2.1 Communication channels such as Slack and Teams

Slack is a team communication platform. Slack offers functionalities such as text messaging, file and media sharing, voice and video calls, and group chat for team collaboration.
Microsoft Teams is a communication platform. Teams primarily competes with Slack, offering workspace chat and videoconferencing, file storage and application integration.
Both are used for real-time communication. They can be used to track task progress but this would involve constant updates from users.
2.2.2 Task prioritisation by Trello
Trello is a web-based, kanban-style, list-making application. It allows users to create task boards with different columns and move the tasks between them. These columns include task statuses . Trello is used for task assignment, tracking and collaboration. It also provides visual task prioritisation and management. 
2.2.3 Task tracking by Asana
Asana is a web and mobile work management platform that helps teams organise, track and manage their work. It is basically used for task tracking, progress monitoring, and visualisation of task statuses.

2.3 The gap

While existing systems may offer some automation, integration, and scalability features, they often fall short in providing an efficient solution to task management challenges. Existing systems lack some capabilities such as drag-and-drop task management and automated report generation. Moreover, existing systems may involve the use of separate tools for communication, task tracking, and resource management, resulting in fragmented workflows. Additionally, existing systems may struggle with scalability and flexibility, limiting their ability to adapt to changing project requirements and team dynamics. Furthermore, existing systems may lack robust data security measures, putting sensitive task-related data at risk. Overall, the gap in existing systems highlights the need for a comprehensive and efficient task management solution.
